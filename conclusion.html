      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>The MedStar Patient Portal is a system where patients and medical personnel alike can have a central location for all of their important information and communication. In our overview and analysis of the webpage, we looked at the design, communication, and functionality of the portal to make sure it fit the mission of the MedStar system, but also the needs of the patients. Through a literature review, heuristic analysis, and user testing, we have found different aspects of strengths and weaknesses in the system for users. Some of the main strengths were the readability of the website, along with the layout and design. The main weaknesses are in their security and the messaging/scheduling platform. Ultimately, while there is room for improvement, there is a good foundation within the current system to help provide the quality care that MedStar as an organization strives for. </p>
