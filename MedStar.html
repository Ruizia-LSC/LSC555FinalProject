<h1>Organization and Information System Description</h1>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;"> MedStar Health is a non-profit, community- based healthcare organization serving the Maryland and Washington, D.C. region. It was established in 1998 following the merger of Helix Health and Medlantic Healthcare Group. 
 Today, MedStar operates more than more than “300 care locations [including] 10 hospitals, 33 urgent care clinics, ambulatory care centers, and primary and specialty care providers,” (MedStar, About Us) making it one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;"> The organization’s mission centers on delivering high-quality, patient-centered care, advancing health through research and education, and improving access to services for the diverse communities it serves (MedStar, Equity).</p> 
<p>The information system selected for this project is the MedStar Health Patient Portal, an online platform that provides patients with secure access to their health records and care services. The portal is supported by MedConnectHealth, a patient engagement solution that facilitates:
</p>  
<ul>
<li>Viewing test and lab results</li>
<li>Messaging providers</li>
 <li>Viewing lab results</li>
 <li>Accessing visit summaries and notes</li>
 <li>Managing medications and refills</li>
<p>This system allows patients to be more directly involved in their healthcare, aligning with MedStar's commitment to patient-centered services and digital health innovation. In the context of MedStar’s goals, the portal supports improved patient engagement, timely access to personal health data, and streamlined communication between patients and healthcare providers. 
 In addition, the primary users of this system are current MedStar patients and their caregivers. The portal may also be accessed by MedStar staff for support or administrative functions, though this project will focus on the patient-facing experience.
