<h1>Organization and Information System Description</h1>
<p> MedStar Health is a non-profit, community- based healthcare organization serving the Maryland and Washington, D.C. region. It was established in 1998 following the merger of Helix Health and Medlantic Healthcare Group. 
 Today, MedStar operates more than more than “300 care locations [including] 10 hospitals, 33 urgent care clinics, ambulatory care centers, and primary and specialty care providers,” (MedStar, About Us) making it one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p> The organization’s mission centers on delivering high-quality, patient-centered care, advancing health through research and education, and improving access to services for the diverse communities it serves (MedStar, Equity).</p> 
<p>The information system selected for this project is the MedStar Health Patient Portal, an online platform that provides patients with secure access to their health records and care services. The portal is supported by MedConnectHealth, a patient engagement solution that facilitates:
</p>  
<ul>
<li>Viewing test and lab results</li>
 <li>Messaging providers</li>
 <li>Viewing lab results</li>
 <li>Accessing visit summaries and notes</li>
 <li>Managing medications and refills</li>
</ul> 
<p>This system allows patients to be more directly involved in their healthcare, aligning with MedStar's commitment to patient-centered services and digital health innovation. In the context of MedStar’s goals, the portal supports improved patient engagement, timely access to personal health data, and streamlined communication between patients and healthcare providers. In addition, the primary users of this system are current MedStar patients and their caregivers. The portal may also be accessed by MedStar staff for support or administrative functions, though this project will focus on the patient-facing experience.</p>
<h2>MedStar Mission and Technological Plan</h2>
 <p>MedStar has institution priorities that hemp drive them in everything they do. That is their mission, vision, and values.</p>
 <p>Mission - “To serve our patients, those who care for them, and our communities.”</p>
 <p>Vision - “To be the trusted leader in caring for people and advancing health.”</p>
 <p>Values - “SPIRIT values— Service, Patient first, Integrity, Respect, Innovation, and Teamwork”</p>
 <h1>Evaluation of Information System</h1>
 <h3>How We Conducted Our Analysis</h3>
 <ol>
<li>Literature Review: We analyzed current research on other telehealth and patient portals to have a solid foundation of what the portal should look like and provide to users for an optimal outcome.</li>
<li>Heuristic Analysis: We used Heuristics and Human Computer Interaction framework to contribute to the assessment of the patient portal as a whole.</li>
<li>User Testing: To better understand how the current patient portal supports or hinders users in completing common tasks, we conducted a small-scale usability test. The goal was to gather first-hand insights into how users interact with the portal’s features, identify pain points, and note aspects of the design that work well.</li>
 </ol>
 <h2>Literature Review</h2>
 <p>Based on the current accademic literature available we have divided the recomendations and analysis into two parts. One section being elements of a good patient paortal, and the other being elements that do not match a good patient portal.</p>
<h3>Elements of a Good Patient Health Portal:</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Patient-Centered Design:</li>
      <ul>
           <li>Focus on Patient Needs: Portals should be designed to address patients' unique information needs, helping them interpret and make decisions about their health information. Simply providing access to data is insufficient; design strategies are needed to help patients interpret and manage results. (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
            <li>User-Centered Design: Rigorous user-centered design and iterative testing are crucial throughout the development process to ensure the design meets user needs and to identify and resolve usability issues. This includes involving users early and continuously. (LeRouge et al., 2017)</li>
            <li>Cognitive Support: Systems should support the complex goals and work tasks of users, not just surface-level usability. For patient portals, this means facilitating a patient's ability to "make sense" of results and inform their decision-making and subsequent actions. (Fairbanks et al., 2016)</li>
           <li>Personalized Information: Users have a strong preference for personalized information. (McAlearney, 2017)</li>
      </ul>
 <li>Clear and Understandable Content:</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Simplified Language: Use simple, non-technical language to describe medical concepts, tests, and services. Content should be appropriate for varying levels of health literacy. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
          <li>Clarity in Processes: Instructions for actions, such as initiating orders, should be clear and easy to understand. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
          <li>Contextual Information: Provide context for why information is presented and explain its importance. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li> 
          <li>Purposeful Messaging: If a system allows for "self-ordering" or "requesting" care, it should clearly state the purpose of the task. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
          <li>Helpful Descriptions: Ensure descriptions are accurate and easy to read, verified by experts (like clinicians). (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
      </ul>
   <li>Effective Information Display:</li>
   <ul>
         <li>Organized Layout: Information should be logically grouped (e.g., using unified colors, proximity, bounding boxes).</li>
         <li>Prioritization: Place information of greatest interest to users in prominent positions, such as the upper left-hand corner of a webpage.</li>
         <li>Accessibility of Results: Provide easy accessibility to imaging and lab results. This includes displaying visual ranges for laboratory values.</li>
         <li>Integrated Views: Offer holistic views of patient information, rather than silos of data.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Functionality and Usability (Ease of Use):</li>
    <ul>
          <li>Actionability: Empower patients to initiate actions related to their care, such as ordering recommended services.</li>
          <li>Responsiveness to User Needs: Incorporate options like declining a service if a patient is not ready or has an upcoming appointment.</li>
          <li>Intuitive Navigation: Design for clear navigation, with features like a "back arrow" button, and make interactive elements (like buttons or test components) obviously clickable.</li>
          <li>Reduced Clicks/Redundancy: Minimize extra clicks and repetitive screens. An ideal unconstrained design might link to additional information rather than putting all details on one screen, and use clear buttons for actions.</li>
          <li>Integration: Ideally, integrate the portal with the broader EHR system to allow providers to view patient summaries and past medical information across the healthcare system.</li>
          <li>Feedback/Confirmation: Provide confirmation messages for actions taken.</li>
          <li>Linking Information: Ability to highlight and link information that is related across the display.</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Support and Trust:</li>
    <ul>
         <li>Build Trust: Address skepticism about automated systems by associating alerts or requests with the patient's doctor's office and clarifying who on the care team will be informed.</li>
         <li>Educational Resources: Provide links to reputable internet resources for more information.</li>
         <li>Training and Instruction: Offer instruction and training on how to use the portal, potentially through multi-modal approaches like in-person training.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<h3>Elements that Do Not Make a Good Patient Health Portal:</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Lack of Patient-Centered Design:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-Patient-Centered Default: Current portals often are not designed in a patient-centered way.</li>  
        <li>Focus on "Look and Feel" over Usefulness: Premature focus on surface-level usability features (e.g., color, shape of icons) at the expense of adequately supporting the user's work can be a pitfall.</li>
        <li>Insufficient User Knowledge: Errors can arise from users not having enough knowledge about the application.</li>
 
   </ul>
<li>Complex or Unclear Content:</li>
   <ul>
        <il>Difficult Medical Content: Patients struggle with medical content that is hard to understand. Language that is too technical or introduces unfamiliar concepts (e.g., "ordering" care instead of "requesting") can cause hesitation and confusion.</il>
        <il>Missing Information: Patients may feel that information is missing, such as details about medication options, disease specifics, or "normal" values for someone like them.</il>
        <li>Distrust: Patients may distrust automated systems, especially if they are unsure how alerts are generated or how the system integrates with their care team.</li>
   </ul>
<li>Poor Information Display and Visualization:</li>
   <ul>
        <li>Inappropriate Interface Design: Failure to provide necessary visual cues and reference information.</li>
        <li>Overwhelming/Misinterpreted Visualizations: Visualizations that are overwhelming, misinterpreted, or unused compromise the system's usability and usefulness.</li>
        <li>Suboptimal Graph Design: Graph designs that are confusing, such as inconsistent data labels that distort visual decoding, or inconsistent use of color for grouping.</li>
       <li>Poor Layout: Key elements not visually grouped or placed with sufficient proximity, leading to errors in interpretation. Visual disassociation of related information (e.g., scores and descriptive text) increases cognitive effort.</li>
       <li>Inefficient Use of Space: Large charts to depict only a few numbers, or graphs that do not fill their allocated data field, are inefficient.</li>
       <li>Unconventional Text/Graphing: Vertically oriented text, undefined acronyms, lack of descriptive graph titles, or non-standard axis labels are problematic. Incorrect use of graph types, like line graphs for irregularly collected data, can lead to inaccurate interpretations.</li>
   </ul>
 <li>Poor Functionality and Usability (Difficulty of Use):</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed Design Constraints: Inherent design constraints of underlying EHR systems can limit the ability to modify layouts and create redundancy or extra clicks for users.</li>
        <li>Complex User Interfaces: Interfaces that are difficult to navigate or require "too many clicks" create a burden for users.</li>
        <li>Lack of Flexibility: Systems that limit flexibility in describing patient conditions or clutter the interface with many difficult-to-identify icons.</li>
        <li>Errors from Assumptions: Design issues can arise from assumptions about system functionalities that don't match user expectations.</li>
        <li>Information Silos: Current EHRs often store information in silos, making it challenging to see related information or share it across provider roles.</li>
        <li>Information Loss/Inaccuracy: Issues where information is not retrievable, trustworthy, accurate, available, or located in the wrong patient's chart.</li>
    </ul>
   <li>Lack of Support and Training:</li>
     <ul>
         <li>Insufficient Instruction: Patients may indicate a need for more instruction and training on using the portal.</li>
         <li>Provider Burden: Providers may feel that teaching patients how to use the portal is "one more thing to do" and beyond their scope of work, especially if their own training was unhelpful.</li>
  
     </ul>

<h2>Usability Test</h2>
 <p>To evaluate the patient-facing usability of the MedStar Patient Portal, we conducted a small-scale, task-based usability test with one current MedStar patient. The goal was to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential barriers to completing common healthcare-related tasks. The participant was given six realistic scenarios to perform in the portal, while observations and participant comments were recorded. We also asked brief follow-up questions to better understand their reasoning and impressions. These observations formed the basis for our analysis of the system’s usability, with a focus on both strengths and areas for improvement.</p>
<h3>Tasks and Findings</h3>  
  <ol>
    <li>Log In – The participant quickly located and accessed the login page via a web search, successfully logging in with only a username and password. No multi-factor authentication was required, which may raise security concerns given MedStar’s past data breach.</li>
   <li>View Lab/Test Results – Results were easily located via the “Lab Results” link on the home page. The participant found the information understandable and clear.</li>
   <li>Message a Provider – Messaging was accessible. The interface supported searching for providers, auto-populated provider details, allowed entry of a message topic, and supported attachments.</li>
   <li>Schedule a Vaccination Appointment – While the “Schedule an Appointment” link was easy to find, the process required selecting a specific provider the patient had seen before, without an option to search by service type (e.g., vaccination). The participant noted they would likely seek vaccination services elsewhere (e.g., pharmacy) if unsure how to proceed. Attempting to book a primary care visit redirected to a different portal.</li>
   <li>Find a Visit Summary – No direct “Visit Summary” button was present as with the previous tasks. The participant located this information via Health Record → Summary of Care. Options to download as PDF or XML (secured/unsecured) were available.</li>
   <li>Log Out – The participant easily located the “Sign Out” button under their profile name. The button’s contrasting color aided discoverability.</li>
  </ol>
