<h2>Heuristic Analysis:</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">As a teacher, I wanted students to look up views and articles about Marijuana in the Tower Archives. I started off by searching for “weed”, and then searching for similar terms such as “marijuana.” There are not too many results in the archive for these search terms. However, under semantic search the student can get around 18 results. The results would be enough for a decent amount of research for the students to see what what were the priorities of the time. 
</p>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>The site design is relatively easy to use, with a student being able to search directly from the link that would be sent to them by an instructor. Key terms are able to be found in the document easily with the search bar at the top of the document itself and the “search matches” drop down menu on the side. In addition, there is also the collection by date, which would be good for students looking for specific time periods of information.</li>
<li>In Heuritic terms, the system is using recognition rather than recall and is also using the users language. In addition, the system itself has a minimalistic and easily useable design making all available information clear and easy to use for student use and cognition.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, there are many parts where a user can go astray. If a user wanted to use the advanced search function that JSTOR provides, the advanced search function would not be able to work under the Tower Archives. So a student could click “Advanced Search” at the top of the page and make it seem like they can get more information that way. However, it would take the user to the whole JSTOR archive instead.In Heuristic terms there is no error prevention to let the user know they are leaving the tower archives. There is also no way to tell users to go back to the archives except to go back to the original search page. A user can press the back arrow as well, but it could leave a lot of confusion in its wake.</li>
<li>Another part of the system that is not necessarily the archives fault, but a fault of the system is the new AI tool of “Semantic Search.” It is overall confusing and would not be helpful for the assigned project if a student needed to stay within the archives themselves. It does not allow for flexibility of use, and instead can hinder research if the AI technology is not matching to the article properly like it is meant to.</li>
