      <h1>Evaluation of Information System</h1>
      <h3>How We Conducted the Evaluation</h3>
      <p>Our evaluation combined three complementary approaches:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>Background Research</b>: Reviewed recent studies on patient portals and telehealth tools to identify best practices and common usability pitfalls.</li>
         <li><b>Heuristic Analysis</b>: Applied established usability heuristics and Human–Computer Interaction principles to assess the portal’s interface and functionality.</li>
         <li><b>User Testing</b>: Conducted a small-scale usability test to observe how participants completed typical tasks, noting both pain points and effective features.</li>
      </ul>
      <br> 
      <hr>
      <h2>Background Research</h2>
      <p>Research on patient portals identifies several design and functionality elements that enhance patient engagement and usability. Conversely, many common challenges for patient portal design were also identified in the literature. These research-based principles guided our heuristic analysis and informed the usability tasks in our user testing. By comparing the MedStar Patient Portal against both the best practices and known pitfalls, we could identify where it meets, exceeds, or falls short of user-centered design standards.</p>

            <h3>Best Practices for an Effective Patient Portal</h3>
            <ol>
               <li><b>Patient-Centered Design</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Focus on Patient Needs: Portals should be designed to address patients' unique information needs, helping them interpret and make decisions about their health information. Simply providing access to data is insufficient; design strategies are needed to help patients interpret and manage results. (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
                  <li>User-Centered Design: Rigorous user-centered design and iterative testing are crucial throughout the development process to ensure the design meets user needs and to identify and resolve usability issues. This includes involving users early and continuously. (LeRouge et al., 2017)</li>
                  <li>Cognitive Support: Systems should support the complex goals and work tasks of users, not just surface-level usability. For patient portals, this means facilitating a patient's ability to "make sense" of results and inform their decision-making and subsequent actions. (Fairbanks et al., 2016)</li>
                  <li>Personalized Information: Users have a strong preference for personalized information. (McAlearney et al., 2017)</li>
               </ul>
               <li><b>Clear and Understandable Content</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Simplified Language: Use simple, non-technical language to describe medical concepts, tests, and services. Content should be appropriate for varying levels of health literacy. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Clarity in Processes: Instructions for actions, such as initiating orders, should be clear and easy to understand. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Contextual Information: Provide context for why information is presented and explain its importance. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Purposeful Messaging: If a system allows for "self-ordering" or "requesting" care, it should clearly state the purpose of the task. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Helpful Descriptions: Ensure descriptions are accurate and easy to read, verified by experts (like clinicians). (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
               </ul>
               <li><b>Effective Information Display</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Organized Layout: Information should be logically grouped (e.g., using unified colors, proximity, bounding boxes). (LeRouge et al., 2017)</li>
                  <li>Prioritization: Place information of greatest interest to users in prominent positions, such as the upper left-hand corner of a webpage. (LeRouge et al., 2017)</li>
                  <li>Accessibility of Results: Provide easy accessibility to imaging and lab results. This includes displaying visual ranges for laboratory values. (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
               </ul>
               <li><b>Functionality and Usability (Ease of Use)</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Actionability: Empower patients to initiate actions related to their care, such as ordering recommended services. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Responsiveness to User Needs: Incorporate options like declining a service if a patient is not ready or has an upcoming appointment. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Intuitive Navigation: Design for clear navigation, with features like a "back arrow" button, and make interactive elements (like buttons or test components) obviously clickable. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Reduced Clicks/Redundancy: Minimize extra clicks and repetitive screens. An ideal unconstrained design might link to additional information rather than putting all details on one screen, and use clear buttons for actions. (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
                  <li>Feedback/Confirmation: Provide confirmation messages for actions taken. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
               </ul>
               <li><b>Support and Trust</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Build Trust: Address skepticism about automated systems by associating alerts or requests with the patient's doctor's office and clarifying who on the care team will be informed. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Educational Resources: Provide links to reputable internet resources for more information. (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
                  <li>Training and Instruction: Offer instruction and training on how to use the portal, potentially through multi-modal approaches like in-person training. (McAlearney et al., 2017)</li>
               </ul>
            </ol>

            <h3>Barriers to an Effective Patient Portal</h3>
            <ol>
               <li><b>Lack of Patient-Centered Design</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Non-Patient-Centered Default: Current portals often are not designed in a patient-centered way. (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
                  <li>Focus on "Look and Feel" over Usefulness: Premature focus on surface-level usability features (e.g., color, shape of icons) at the expense of adequately supporting the user's work can be a pitfall. (Fairbanks et al., 2016)</li>
                  <li>Insufficient User Knowledge: Errors can arise from users not having enough knowledge about the application. (McAlearney et al., 2017)</li>
               </ul>
               <li><b>Complex or Unclear Content</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Difficult Medical Content: Patients struggle with medical content that is hard to understand. Language that is too technical or introduces unfamiliar concepts (e.g., "ordering" care instead of "requesting") can cause hesitation and confusion. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Missing Information: Patients may feel that information is missing, such as details about medication options, disease specifics, or "normal" values for someone like them. (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
                  <li>Distrust: Patients may distrust automated systems, especially if they are unsure how alerts are generated or how the system integrates with their care team. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
               </ul>
               <li><b>Poor Information Display and Visualization</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Inappropriate Interface Design: Failure to provide necessary visual cues and reference information. (Nystrom et al., 2018)</li>
                  <li>Overwhelming/Misinterpreted Visualizations: Visualizations that are overwhelming, misinterpreted, or unused compromise the system's usability and usefulness. (LeRouge et al., 2017)</li>
                  <li>Poor Layout: Key elements not visually grouped or placed with sufficient proximity, leading to errors in interpretation. Visual disassociation of related information (e.g., scores and descriptive text) increases cognitive effort. (LeRouge et al., 2017)</li>
                  <li>Inefficient Use of Space: Large charts to depict only a few numbers, or graphs that do not fill their allocated data field, are inefficient. (LeRouge et al., 2017)</li>
                  <li>Unconventional Text/Graphing: Vertically oriented text, undefined acronyms, lack of descriptive graph titles, or non-standard axis labels are problematic. Incorrect use of graph types, like line graphs for irregularly collected data, can lead to inaccurate interpretations. (LeRouge et al., 2017)</li>
               </ul>
               <li><b>Poor Functionality and Usability (Difficulty of Use)</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Fixed Design Constraints: Inherent design constraints of underlying EHR systems can limit the ability to modify layouts and create redundancy or extra clicks for users. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Complex User Interfaces: Interfaces that are difficult to navigate or require "too many clicks" create a burden for users. (Nelson et al., 2023)</li>
                  <li>Lack of Flexibility: Systems that limit flexibility in describing patient conditions or clutter the interface with many difficult-to-identify icons. (Fairbanks et al., 2016)</li>
                  <li>Errors from Assumptions: Design issues can arise from assumptions about system functionalities that don't match user expectations. (McAlearney et al., 2017)</li>
                  <li>Information Loss/Inaccuracy: Issues where information is not retrievable, trustworthy, accurate, available, or located in the wrong patient's chart. (Fairbanks et al., 2016)</li>
               </ul>
               <li><b>Lack of Support and Training</b>:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Insufficient Instruction: Patients may indicate a need for more instruction and training on using the portal. (McAlearney et al., 2017)</li>
                  <li>Provider Burden: Providers may feel that teaching patients how to use the portal is "one more thing to do" and beyond their scope of work, especially if their own training was unhelpful. (McAlearney et al., 2017)</li>
               </ul>
            </ol>

      </div>
      <p>In summary, a good patient portal prioritizes intuitive navigation, clear and accessible communication, features that help patients take action on their care, and reliable support resources. In contrast, poorly designed portals are often burdened by complex interfaces, unclear information, limited features, and design flaws that undermine ease of use and patient trust.</p>

      <h2>Heuristic Analysis Notes</h2>
      <p>To evaluate the MedStar Patient Portal, we conducted a heuristic analysis based on Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. While there is current research and a compelling on tailoring a set of heuristics specifically for patient portals, Nielsen’s heuristics are widely recognized as a standard framework in the field of usability evaluation. This approach allowed us to identify potential usability issues across the portal and to highlight areas where the design aligns with best practices.</p>

<p>The heuristic evaluation of the MedStar Patient Portal indicates that the system generally aligns with standard usability principles, with particular strengths in aesthetic design, consistency, and matching users expectations. Users can navigate the system without encountering significant confusion, and visual design choices such as appealing colors contribute to a generally pleasant user experience.</p>
<p>However, several usability issues were identified that could hinder efficiency, reduce user satisfaction, or introduce errors. These include limited feedback during system processing, the inability to easily cancel certain actions, insufficient personalization options, and challenges in accessing help or guidance for less common tasks. Error prevention and recovery mechanisms are present but could be strengthened, particularly around messaging providers and ensuring that users understand the implications of their actions.</p>
<p>Overall, the heuristic analysis suggests that while the portal supports core user tasks effectively, there is room for improvement in areas that enhance transparency, user control, and efficiency. Addressing these issues would help align the system more closely with best practices in usability and patient-centered design.</p>

      <h2>Usability Test</h2>
      <p>To evaluate the patient-facing usability of the MedStar Patient Portal, we conducted a small-scale, task-based usability test with one current MedStar patient. The goal was to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential barriers to completing common healthcare-related tasks. The participant was given six realistic scenarios to perform in the portal, while observations and participant comments were recorded. We also asked brief follow-up questions to better understand their reasoning and impressions. These observations formed the basis for our analysis of the system’s usability, with a focus on both strengths and areas for improvement.</p>
      <h3>Tasks and Findings</h3>
      <ol>
         <li><b>Log In</b> – The participant quickly located and accessed the login page via a web search, successfully logging in with only a username and password. No multi-factor authentication was required, which may raise security concerns given MedStar’s past data breach.</li>
         <li><b>View Lab/Test Results</b> – Results were easily located via the “Lab Results” link on the home page. The participant found the information understandable and clear.</li>
         <li><b>Message a Provider</b> – Messaging was accessible. The interface supported searching for providers, auto-populated provider details, allowed entry of a message topic, and supported attachments.</li>
         <li><b>Schedule a Vaccination Appointment</b> – While the “Schedule an Appointment” link was easy to find, the process required selecting a specific provider the patient had seen before, without an option to search by service type (e.g., vaccination). The participant noted they would likely seek vaccination services elsewhere (e.g., pharmacy) if unsure how to proceed. Attempting to book a primary care visit redirected to a different portal.</li>
         <li><b>Find a Visit Summary</b> – No direct “Visit Summary” button was present as with the previous tasks. The participant located this information via Health Record → Summary of Care. Options to download as PDF or XML (secured/unsecured) were available.</li>
         <li><b>Log Out</b> – The participant easily located the “Sign Out” button under their profile name. The button’s contrasting color aided discoverability.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Positive Observations</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Clear, consistent navigation menus across the top and left.</li>
