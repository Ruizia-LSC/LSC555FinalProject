      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2> Organizational Context </h2>

      <p> MedStar Health is a non-profit, community-based healthcare organization serving the Maryland and Washington, D.C. region. Established in 1998 through the merger of Helix Health and Medlantic Healthcare Group, MedStar now operates more than more than “300 care locations [including] 10 hospitals, 33 urgent care clinics, ambulatory care centers, and primary and specialty care providers” (MedStar, About Us) making it one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the mid-Atlantic.
      </p>

      <p>MedStar’s mission centers on delivering high-quality, patient-centered care, advancing health through research and education, and improving access to services for the diverse communities it serves (MedStar, Equity).</p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>To serve our patients, those who care for them, and our communities.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>

            <ul>
               <li>Service</li>
               <li>Patient First</li>
               <li>Integrity</li>
               <li>Respect</li>
               <li>Innovation</li>

      <h2> System Overview</h2>
      <p>The information system selected for this project is the MedStar Health Patient Portal, an online platform that provides patients with secure access to their health records and care services. The portal is supported by MedConnectHealth, a patient engagement solution that facilitates:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>Viewing test and lab results</li>
         <li>Messaging providers</li>
         <li>Viewing lab results</li>
         <li>Accessing visit summaries and notes</li>
         <li>Managing medications and refills</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This system empowers patients to take a more active role in their healthcare, aligning with MedStar's commitment to patient-centered services and digital health innovation. In the context of MedStar’s organizational goals, the portal supports patient engagement, timely access to personal health data, and streamlined communication between patients and providers.</p>

      <h2>Users, Content, and Context</h2>
      <p>The primary users of the portal are MedStar patients, though caregivers with appropriate permissions and healthcare providers also interact with the system. Content within the portal includes personal health information (e.g., lab results, visit summaries, prescriptions), administrative details (insurance information, billing statements), and communication tools (secure messaging). The portal exists within the broader context of digital healthcare, where secure online access to health information is increasingly critical for patient engagement, continuity of care, and compliance with privacy regulations such as HIPAA.</p>

      <h2>Purpose of the Evaluation</h2>
      <p>This project evaluates the usability and effectiveness of the MedStar Patient Portal, focusing on how easily patients can complete common tasks such as scheduling appointments and accessing test results. Our aim is to identify strengths and potential areas for improvement to enhance patient engagement.</p>

      <h2>Scope and Limitations</h2>
      <p>The evaluation is limited to the patient-facing components of the portal and does not address back-end administrative tools or provider interfaces. Our analysis emphasizes the desktop web version, though mobile functionality is noted where relevant.</p>
